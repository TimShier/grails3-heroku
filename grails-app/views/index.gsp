            <h1>Welcome to HelloWorld!</h1>

            <p>
                This is basically the default application BUT, it is hosted live.

            </p>

                Practically this means that a) it's possible on the new Grails 3 and b) I can now develop and spin up code VERY quickly now that this ground work is done
