# grails3-heroku
Standard Heroku app for Grails 3.

Intended as a restart app for future use. Presently has a domain HelloWord to ensure DB is working both locally (dev mode) and on Heroku (production mode).

Based on process described by David Estes (http://davydotcom.com/blog/2015-05-31-running-grails-3-on-heroku). Thanks Dave!
